Dear {!Connection_ExternalContactFirstName},

{!User.FirstName} {!User.LastName} at {!Organization.Name} has deactivated your Salesforce to Salesforce connection. You can still access records that were shared over this connection, but updates will no longer be sent between your Salesforce organizations.

Thank you,

The Salesforce Team
